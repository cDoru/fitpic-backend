# fitpic-backend
FitPic is a React Native app for iOS and Android that helps users to track their fitness progress through consistent photos. When a user takes a new photo, the last photo they took for that pose (front, back, side) is shown at a low opacity over the camera view. Having near-identical photos allows users to more accurately see the progress they've made over their fitness journies. Other features include measurement entries and progress data visualization.

Technologies used include React Native, AWS S3, Auth0, JWT, Multer, Knex, PostgreSQL, Node.js, and Express.
